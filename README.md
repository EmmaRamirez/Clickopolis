## Notes

The `master` branch is now completely different from the others. Check out either one of the feature branches or the `old-master` branch for a snapshot of this project.

This rewrite is fixing some of the issues and transitions to a component-based architecture. Maybe. We'll see.


## Closing Notes
Fuck this repo is a mess right now. im sorry
