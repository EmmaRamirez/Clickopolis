# Clickopolis (WIP)
A clicking-based civilization game.

## Notes
This game is still a work in progress, and as such things are bound to wildly change.

To run, just navigate to `clickopolis-delta` then `npm install` and then type `http-server` in the command line.

Clickopolis-delta is the current working version of the game (written in Typescript :]).
